# Single-source imaging and Agility

Single-source imaging is an essential strategy for companies who wish to reduce maintenance and increase agility.

Instead of creating multiple versions of each digital asset, a single, authoratative, highest-resolution version is stored in a central location, and smaller versions are derived on-demand.

Single-source imaging has been around since the 1990s, but until recently was only accessible to corporations like IBM, Kodak, and HP.

**Pre-resizing images only works well long-term if you're prescient, or store originals and have an elaborate system set up to batch process all your images in a resilient way (P.S, it's hard).**
