# ASP.NET MVC

The ImageResizer is fully MVC (1-4) compatible, however, some routes may conflict with the ImageResizer URLs. 

To resolve this conflict, simply install the [MvcRoutingShim](/plugins/mvcroutingshim) plugin. The MvcRoutingShim plugin prevents routes from messing with a request that is already being processed by the ImageResizer.
