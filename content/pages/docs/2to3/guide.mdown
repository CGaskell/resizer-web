# V2 to V3 migration guide

This guide assumes you have already purchased the V3 Performance bundle. If not, that's your first step.

1. Back up your project, or at least the Web.Config file, /bin, and /App_Code/ImageResizer folders.
2. Delete your /imagecache/ folder.
3. Add the V3 ImageResizer.dll, ImageResizer.Plugins.DiskCache.dll, ImageResizer.Plugins.PrettyGifs.dll, and (optionally) ImageResizer.Plugins.AnimatedGifs.dll to your project, replacing the old DLL if it exists.
4. Users of the source code ("App_Code") version: Migrate your [CustomFolders.cs](customfolders) and [WatermarkSettings.cs](watermarksettings) customizations, then delete the ImageResizer folder of source code.
5. [Migrate your web.config file](configuration).
