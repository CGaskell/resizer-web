# Go high-level with wrappers

Wrappers don't expose the full power of the URL API; they abstract it to a different level. This can be good or bad.

Here are a few we know about (leave a comment if we've missed one!)

* [StudioJS: Image edition studio in jQuery plugin form](https://github.com/nathanaeljones/studiojs)
* [WebCropImage V5: A community update of Cim Sisman's popular (yet abandoned) WebCropImage ASP.NET control](http://webcropimage.com)
* [CropImage.NET: The replacement for WebCropImage](http://cropimage.net)
* ImageStudio (found in /Contrib folder) by Zan Kavtaskin; upload & crop
