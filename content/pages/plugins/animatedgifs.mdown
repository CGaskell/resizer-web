# AnimatedGifs plugin

Adds support for resizing animated gifs. Once added, animated gifs will be resized while maintaining all animated frames. By default, .NET only saves the first frame of the GIF image.

Best used with disk caching, as large animations can take a while to process (sometimes even over a second).

## Installation

* Add ImageResizer.Plugins.AnimatedGifs to your project
* Add `<add name="AnimatedGifs" />` inside `<resizer><plugins></plugins></resizer>` in Web.config.
