#DefaultEncoder

Installed by default. 

Provides adjustable jpeg encoding, 32-bit PNG encoding with transparency support, and standard .NET GIF encoding (which is quite lousy).

Jpeg quality defaults to 90, which is very good balance. You can override the setting by adding &quality=0-100

You can choose the format with &format=png|jpg|gif
