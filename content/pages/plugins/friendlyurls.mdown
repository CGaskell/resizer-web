# FriendlyUrls plugin

Renamed to [FolderResizeSyntax](/plugins/folderresizesyntax) and merged into the Core, ImageResizer.dll in 3.0.12. 

You must change `<add name="FriendlyUrls" />` to `<add name="FolderResizeSyntax" />` before 3.0.13 and remove ImageResizer.Plugins.FriendlyUrls.dll, or the plugin will stop functioning.
