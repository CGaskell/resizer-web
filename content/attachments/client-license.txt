ImageResizer Plugins - PROFESSIONAL CLIENT LICENSE 

This license allows limited use of the ImageResizer plugins you have received as part of a custom software solution from the Provider.

These plugins are usually distributed as dlls, and are named ImageResizer.Plugins.[PluginName].dll.

For this license to be valid, the provider of your software must have a valid Enterprise or Professional license for *all* of the plugins you have received, and you must be a client of the Provider (not an anonymous or 'free' user of their software).

See http://imageresizing.net/licenses/proclient for the latest version of this license. 

You can purchase a full license at http://imageresizing.net/ for a very reasonable cost, which frees you from the multitude of restrictions contained in this license.

License Terms

A holder of a Professional/Enterprise license (the Provider) may grant another individual/business (the Client) the Professional Client license, which allows the Client to use the Software as part of a larger piece of software (the Project) provided by the Provider. This license is only valid if the Project does not compete with any previously existing product offerings of the original author of the Software.

The "Software" is the plugin which is being sub-licensed by a Provider to a Client.

The "Client" may not be anonymous to the Provider - their must exist proof that the Client has purchased the Project from the Provider.

The Client is granted the following rights:

* Usage on an unlimited number of virtual or physical machines machines operated and either owned, rented, or licensed by the license holder. For example, this includes qualifying shared hosting plans, EC2 instances, dedicated co-located servers, development machines, or test servers.
* Modification of configuration settings related to the Software.

The Client is prohibited from:

* Using the Software except as part the Project provided by the Provider.
* Modifying the way in which the Software is integrated with the Project.
* Using or integrating the Software with another project or web site.
* Extracting the Software from the Project.
* Redistributing the Software.
* Modifying the Software.

All of the above restrictions are lifted with a Professional or Enterprise license, which can be purchased by the Client for a reasonable fee at http://imageresizing.net/. If the Client purchases a Professional or Enterprise license, they will be subject to those terms instead, and this license will become null and void.

All rights are reserved unless explicitly specified. This license is only valid when and if the Provider holds a valid, qualifying license.
