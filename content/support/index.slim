		h2 Before you contact us
		markdown:

			1. Visit the [self-diagnostics page](/plugins/diagnostics) on your server: `/resizer.debug.ashx`
			2. Enable [detailed error messages, and visit the image URL directly](/docs/geterror)
			3. Skim the comprehensive [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshoot) and [faq](/docs/faq). If it's a *how-to* question, [try reading the documentation](/docs) or [searching this site](/search) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer).
			
			When contacting support about a problem, *please* include (a) the [diagnostics page output](/plugins/diagnostics), and (b) [the precise error message you get when you put the image URL directly into the address bar](/docs/geterror). Without this information, **we cannot diagnose the problem**. It's also a good idea to skim the [troubleshooting page](/docs/troubleshoot), as there's a good chance it covers your issue.

		h2 Free support
		markdown:
			Free support is provided for [questions posted on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer), *if they meet the following criteria*:

			1. The question is [tagged 'imageresizer'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer) so we can find it.
			2. The question includes a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the diagnostics page output.
			3. The question is detailed enough to answer, shows some diagnostic effort, and doesn't [involve a really bad idea](/docs/bad).
			5. The question is about the URL API (If you have a *smart* questions about the Managed API, we *may* help you...)

			We typically answer StackOverflow questions within 1-2 weeks. E-mail your question URL to **support@imageresizing.net** for a faster response. 

			If we take the time to provide a good answer to your question, please be courteous; both mark it as the answer and vote it up. We prioritize questions posted by registered StackOverflow users who have a good reputation.

		h2 Bugs & Features
		markdown: 
			We offer free support for all bug-related inquires, both through e-mail (**support@imageresizing.net**) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer).

			To encourage everyone to actively look for bugs and report them, we're offering a $5-$50 reward via PayPal for each bug you report (if you're the first to report it). Most bug reports are firmly in the $5 category, but a security hole or memory leak could net you $50 each. Payments sent via PayPal. All Imazen-provided class libraries whose names start with ImageResizer are eligible. Email bug reports to `support@imageresizing.net`. Only the latest version of the product is eligible.

			We welcome feature requests, and everyone may [sumbit new ideas or vote for existing ones at the uservoice site](http://resizer.uservoice.com/forums/108373-image-resizer-v3).

		h2 Priority Support
		markdown:
			Priority email, phone and TeamViewer support costs $135/incident. A [30-minute Q&A session costs $70](/support/consult), but (unlike) a support incident, is time-limited and only reccomended for consulting/introduction purposes.

			If you work for a business, please [look at the support contract options](/support/contracts) - they can provide significant savings. 

			It is suggested that you download and install [Team Viewer](http://teamviewer.com) on the computer in question, as remote desktop access may be required to resolve your issue.

			Credit cards, PayPal, and Google Checkout are accepted.

Both online tickets and this e-mail address are immediately forwarded to my personal e-mail account, so please use them! It helps me track support requests in a more organized manner. If you e-mail me at my personal e-mail address (nathanael.jones@gmail.com), your request may get lost!
