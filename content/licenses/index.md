title: Licenses - Image Resizer

#Licenses

The core and [18 plugins](/plugins/free) are free and open-source. No restrictions, no money, no strings attached. They are provided under [a modified MIT license called the Freedom license][freedom]. 

Development of this project is funded by people purchasing [the enhanced editions (which include additional plugins)](/buy) and [support contracts](/support/contracts). 

The enhanced editions are also *nearly* open-source. They all include source code, encourage modification, and accept patches. Redistribution and sub-licensing rights vary by license, however. 

### Easy rules

 * If it is in the `ImageResizer.Plugins.Basic` namespace, it is under the [Freedom license][freedom]. 
 * All sample source code is under the [Freedom license][freedom].
 * If it is part of `ImageResizer.dll` or `ImageResizer.Mvc.dll`, then it's under the [Freedom license][freedom].
 * If the dll is named `ImageResizer.Plugins.something.dll`, it's probably a [paid plugin](/plugins).
 * Except for `ImageResizer.Plugins.Logging.dll`, which is also under the [Freedom license][freedom].
 * Except for `ImageResizer.Plugins.PdfRenderer`, which is [under the GPL v3 due to its use of Ghostscript](/plugins/pdfrenderer).

I have written every license to provide maximum freedom, minimum restrictions, and maximum simplicity. 99% of use cases should be covered, I hope. 

If for some reason the above licenses do not meet your needs, I am willing to provide even less restrictive licenses on a case-by-case basis. E-mail **sales@imageresizing.net** for details.
