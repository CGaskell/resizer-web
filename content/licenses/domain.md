#Imazen Domain License v1.0

## Summary

* You may use the Software on single domain (you have to tell us which one) and its subdomains, without restrictions based on server, CPU, or core count.
* We may allow you to switch domains, but we may eventually impose restrictions on how frequently and how many times you can do so, in order to limit abuse. 
* If you convert your 'Floating' license into a 'Permanent' license, you will not be able to switch domains later.

* You may modify the software as much as you desire, and use your modifications.
* You may redistribute the Software (with or without modifications), but *only* to other license holders.
* You can't resell the software or usage of the software without permission (this is the *wrong* license for running a SaaS).
* We can revoke the license if we think you're abusing it (such as running a SaaS with it, etc).
* Unless you opt-out through e-mail, we get to use your name and logo for promotional purposes. (900 customers, many of them large, and we can't do the cool logo bar thingy yet!)

This summary is not legally binding, but serves as a simplified introduction to the license.

* "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

### 2. Grant of use and modification rights.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants you the following rights:

* You may use the Work or Derivative Works on a single DNS domain (which must be under your control) and its subdomains. You must register the licensed domain with the Licensor via any method the Licensor requests. 
* This license does not restrict the number of virtual or physical machines running the software, as long as the Software is not being used except through the licensed domain name(s).
* We may use our own judgement in determining how frequently and how many times you can change which domain you wish to use under the License, in order to prevent abuse.
* If you choose to convert your license to a 'Permanent' license instead of a 'floating' license, you will not be able to change the licensed domain after that moment.
* You may modify the software as much as you desire, and use your modifications as permitted above.


### 3. Grant of limited redistribution rights.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

* You must verify that the party you are distributing the Work or Derivative Work to also holds a valid License, or is only using the Work and Derivative Works for the same domain already licensed. Public distribution or distribution to parties without a valid license is prohibited. 
* You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; 
* If you redistribute the Work or Derivative Works, you must notify the receiving party of any changes you have made to the Work.
* It is requested, but not required, that you cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files;
* It is requested, but not required, that any changes you intend to redistribute be first submitted to the Licensor for code review. Without code review, the Licensor cannot provide support for the Derivative Work.

### 4. Restrictions and prohbited actions.

* You may not resell the software or usage of the software without written permission from the Licensor (this is the *wrong* license for running a SaaS).
* We reserve the right to revoke your license, without a refund, if we discover evidence of abuse. We are not required to contact you first, but it is likely we will make every effort to do so.
* We reserve the right to evaluate and judge whether an act is an abuse of the license and relationship. Some examples are provided below:

Examples of abuse:

* Using a shared 'static assets domain' for the majority of images across more than 3 customer-facing domains, in order to escape additional licensing costs.
* Redistributing modifications that have a negative impact on the users, community, or Imazen. 

### 5. Marketing.

By purchasing a license, you automatically opt-in to receiving notices of important version releases and announcements. You may opt out of these at any time using the unsubscribe link included in each e-mail.

We also reserve the right to list you as a client or user of the software, and use your logo for promotional purposes, unless you explicitly opt-out via an e-mail to support@imageresizing.net.

### 6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

### 8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
