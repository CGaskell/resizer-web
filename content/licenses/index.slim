      ## Overview
      The core and [18 plugins](/plugins/free) are free and open-source. No restrictions, no money, no strings attached. They are provided under [a modified MIT license called the Freedom license](/licenses/freedom). 

      Development of this project is funded by people purchasing [the enhanced editions (which include additional plugins)](/buy) and [support contracts](/support/contracts). 

      The enhanced editions are also *nearly* open-source. They all include source code, encourage modification, and accept patches. Redistribution and sub-licensing rights vary by license, however. 

      I have written every license to provide maximum freedom, minimum restrictions, and maximum simplicity. 99% of use cases should be covered, I hope. 

      If for some reason the above licenses do not meet your needs, I am willing to provide even less restrictive licenses on a case-by-case basis. E-mail **sales@imageresizing.net** for details.

       * All sample source code is under the [Freedom license](/licenses/freedom).
       * If it is part of `ImageResizer.dll` or `ImageResizer.Mvc.dll`, then it's under the [Freedom license](/licenses/freedom).
