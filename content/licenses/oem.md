# ImageResizer OEM license v1.0

If you wish to sell software licenses for a product which contains ImageResizer plugins, this is the license you need.

This license is very similar to the [Enterprise license][enterprise], but does not restrict redistribution and sub-licensing to bespoke, custom software. 

This license is issued on a case-by-case basis, typically to holders of a Gold [support contract](http://imageresizing.net/support/contracts). If you are interested, please inquire by e-mailing support@imageresizing.net.

To be valid, this license must be combined with a Scope Agreement, which may restrict resale to a particular application line or category, and will specify which plugins and plugin versions are included.


### Example Scope Agreement

This OEM License is granted to "Fictional Acme Corporation" under the following Scope Agreement:

* Future minor upgrades (3.X) and releases of the Work will automatically be covered by 
  this OEM license. Major releases will require a new agreement.
* This OEM License only permits redistribution and resale as part of the 
  "Fictional Acme Widget Application".
* The Work covered by this license includes all eligible ImageResizer plugins currently 
  offered by Imazen LLC, but does not include those licensed under the GPL. 


## License Summary

This license permits:

 * Usage
 * Modification
 * Integration
 * Redistribution and resale as part of a qualifying larger project under the [Professional Client license][proclient].
 * Sub-licensing under the [Professional Client license][proclient].

 The license restricts:

 * Resale or publication of software which competes with previously-existing Imazen software and embeds Imazen software in order to do so.
 * Preventing end users of web-based applications from upgrading ImageResizer dlls or adding additional plugins. 

Unlike the License Terms below, the above human-friendly summary is not legally binding, and is only provided for informational purposes.

### 2. Nature of License.

This license is perpetual, and cannot be transferred.

This license is royalty-free, but has an up-front cost. 

This license can be revoked under any of the following 3 conditions

1. If the terms of this License are violated
2. If payment for this License is refunded at your request.
3. If payment for this License is not completed within the agreed span of time.

To be valid, this license must be accompanied by a Scope Agreement.

Scope Agreements define what the Licensed Work is, which versions are included, and whether major or minor upgrades are included.

Scope Agreements may restrict which products or product types are permitted to include the Licensed Work. 

### 3. Grant of Usage Rights

You and Your Employees are granted the right to use the Work and any Derivative Works on an unlimited number of physical or virtual machines operated AND either owned, rented, or licensed by You or Your employees. 

This includes, but is not limited to, shared hosting plans, EC2 instances, dedicated co-located and on-premise servers, development workstations, and test servers (all of which must meet the above criteria).

**Usage means use, not installation!** For example, this DOES NOT grant a hosting provider the right to install the software for use by all customers, nor provide You the right to *resell* hosted usage of the software (Software as a Service).

### 4. Grant of Modification Rights

You and Your Employees may modify the Work and create Derivative Works without restriction. 

### 5. Grant of Integration Rights

You and Your Employees may integrate and/or link to the Work from an unlimited number of projects. 

### 6. Grant of Redistribution Rights and Requirements

Redistribution of the Work and Derivative Works may only be performed as part of a Larger Project to a Client, with the Work and Derivative Works (but not necessarily the Larger Project) being licensed to the Client under the terms of the [Professional Client License][proclient] or the [Trial License][trial].

For example, You may integrate the Work in a Larger Project for a Client, and the Client may use the Larger Project on any number of servers under the [Professional Client License][proclient]. But for the Client to integrate the Work with another project themselves, they must buy a separate license.

#### Requirements for Redistribution

* You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of the [Professional Client license][proclient], and ensure that those terms are as accessible and prominent as other license files which may accompany the Larger Project.
* You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files.
* You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.
* If the Larger Project is intended to be maintained by the Client or the Client's developers, the Larger Project MUST permit the Work to be upgraded to a new, backwards-compatible revision without loss of functionality.
* If the Larger Project is intended to be extended or edited by the Client in any way (such as a library, framework, CMS, or turnkey package would be), the original extensibility functionality of the Work must be maintained. I.E, if the original Work supported plugins, Clients should be able to install plugins without following a different set of steps.

### 7. Suggestions for Redistribution of Derivative Works

It is suggested, but not required, that changes to the Work and Derivative Works be submitted to the Licensor for code review PRIOR to redistribution. Without code review, the Licensor cannot support modified versions of the Software.

It is suggested, but not required, that a description of the changes made to the Work be included when the Derivative Work is redistributed.


### 8. Sale or publication of Unethical Derivative Works is prohibited 

An "Unethical Derivative Work" is software, in Object or Source form, which (a) competes with any of the Licensor's software, AND (b) was not publicly available prior to the Licensor's software, AND (c) includes any portion of the Work. 

Sale, public distribution, marketing, and publishing of Unethical Derivative Works is prohibited. Development and use of Unethical Derivative Works within Your organization is not prohibited by this clause, but may be subject to other restrictions contained in this license agreement due to its inclusion and/or modification of the Work.

Examples of prohibited actions: 

* Publishing, publicly distributing, marketing, or selling software which combines ImageResizer with disk caching functionality, and is marketed as an imaging library.

To clarify: if you are the 'first to market', you do not have to worry about retroactively being in violation of this clause. 

To comply with this clause, prior to publishing your product, simply compare the purpose of your  product 
to the purpose of each of the products offered on <http://imageresizing.net/> and <http://imazen.io>.
If the purpose or marketing of the products are similar, then you should contact 
support@imageresizing.net for written clarification and permission (provided free of charge, if applicable).

### 9. Submission of Contributions. 

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, by submitting any Contribution to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work, you grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sub-license, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

### 10. Trademarks.

 This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

### 11. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

### 12. Limitation of Liability. 

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 13. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. 

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
